      <h3>Ponniyin Selvan: A guide to the book that inspired Mani Ratnam’s smashing hit</h3>
      <p>
        Mani Ratnam's adaptation of a 2,000-page historical fiction by Kalki Krishnamurthy quickly rose to the top of the charts – all while sparking a wave of conversations on social media. If you aren’t the one to pick up a book or are keen on better understanding the plotline of Ponniyin Selvan without putting in a ton of effort – we’ve got a breezy guide for you.The novel Ponniyin Selvan was first serialised in the weekly editions of a Tamil magazine named Kalki from October 29, 1950 to May 16, 1954. Each would fly off the shelves, with locals discussing the story over Dayakattai (a dice game). Later in 1955, it was integrated into five volumes. The story explores the early days of the Chola prince Arulmozhivarman. Reportedly, adaptation of the series has been quite the subject of discussion in film circles, particularly since the legendary actor-politician MG Ramachandran expressed his desire to do the same with Kamal Hassan and Sridevi.

      <h3>Anime Influenced Some of 2022's Best Games</h3>
      <p>
        While Japanese game creators have been fairly open about their anime and manga inspirations for decades, it's only more recently that Western developers have started to catch on. In particular, it's those in the indie space that have been showing their love for the medium the most, and that's never been more obvious than it has in 2022. The developers behind multiple critically-acclaimed indie titles have talked fondly of watching anime in their formative years and how they have integrated those inspirations into their new games.What's clear is that the term “anime game” could be much broader. Just because something has anime-style character designs doesn't necessarily mean that the game itself has those inspirations. Likewise, a game doesn't necessarily need to look like anime to have been inspired by the medium.

      <h3>On Elon Musk's Twitter, gaming offers a glimpse of a chaotic future</h3>
      <p>
        Video games are a big topic of conversation on Twitter, generating 2.4 billion tweets last year. On new owner Elon Musk’s Twitter, where major executives and nearly half of the company’s workforce have been purged, and where generating revenue is the priority, gaming still has a place. But the drastic changes the company and its more than 200 million daily active users face are reverberating across the gaming community and industry.In May, Twitter’s global head of gaming partnerships, Rishi Chadha, said in an interview with The Washington Post: “When people think about gaming, they’re thinking about the Twitches of the world, the YouTubes of the world. And it’s like actually, you can’t forget what Twitter is doing. Twitter’s been that home for conversation and it’s been silently there.”

      <h3>From Elizabeth Debicki in The Crown to Kristen Stewart in Spencer: the best screen Dianas - ranked!</h3>
      <p>
        Diana, Princess of Wales, was the first and only great media celebrity of the British royal world - a figure with natural glamour, coquettishness and style; someone Camille Paglia once called the last silent-movie star. So it is natural that she should be captured on screen. Perhaps no one has quite nailed it, but here are my Top 5 fictional Dianas.

      <h3>Ponniyin Selvan:1 puts focus on Cholas: what happened during their rule?</h3>
      <p>
        In all the buzz around the Tamil film Ponniyin Selvan:1 or PS1, a fictional period drama directed by filmmaker Mani Ratnam that has grossed around Rs 250 crore worldwide since its release on September 30, a point of focus has been the Chola dynasty that the film is based on.With the film’s release, there is renewed curiosity around the 10th-century kingdom. In Tamil Nadu, which was the centre of the kingdom, the Cholas have been part of the popular imagination for a long time. This is partly thanks to the writer Kalki Krishnamurthi, whose columns on a fictional account of the Chola kingdom appeared in a weekly journal in the early 1950s and garnered popularity. These were later compiled into a novel called ‘Ponniyin Selvan’, which became the inspiration for the movie, whose second part is due for release in 2023.

      <h3>'When Mortals Play God': New book details one family's tragedy</h3>
      <p>
        The practice of eugenics was in vogue in the United States a century ago. The Oxford Dictionary defines eugenics as: “the study of how to arrange reproduction within a human population to increase the occurrence of heritable characteristics regarded as desirable. Developed largely by Sir Francis Galton as a method of improving the human race, eugenics was increasingly discredited as unscientific and racially biased during the 20th century, especially after the adoption of its doctrines by the Nazis in order to justify their treatment of Jews, disabled people, and other minority groups.”
